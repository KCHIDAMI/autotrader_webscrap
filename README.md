scaping autotrader website to get some useful info

here is a little snippet for webscraping autotrader.ca website.
this will allow you to retrieve data by maker, model, year, province and city.
this is a good start for analyzing historical data and having some insights about the car market and/or developing a predictive model for car price prediction.

Enjoy !



code has been made on june 2020, if not working that probably means that autotrader.ca has changed the html structure of webpage or some of the classes name. You should probably dive into html code of the page !
